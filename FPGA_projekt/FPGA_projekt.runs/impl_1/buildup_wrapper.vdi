WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net buildup_i/spi_sub_0/U0/MISO_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin buildup_i/spi_sub_0/U0/MISO_reg_i_2/O, cell buildup_i/spi_sub_0/U0/MISO_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
